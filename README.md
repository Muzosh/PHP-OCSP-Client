# PHP-OCSP-Client
* PHP library for handling OCSP requests and responses
* Functionality is already done in https://github.com/Muzosh/web-eid-authtoken-validation-php. I will extract the OCSP client into separate library here.

## UPDATE FALL 2022
- there is no need to extract it from validation library, Web-eID developers already did it in [here](https://github.com/web-eid/ocsp-php) (check branch `development`)
